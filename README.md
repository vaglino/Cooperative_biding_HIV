Chemical kinetics modeling of the trimolecular Env-CD4-CXCR4 reaction

Performs fitting of adhesion frequency data and bond lifetime distributions with any kinetics model scheme defined, determines kinetic rates and compares different models statistically.

Association fitting
-adhesion frequency modeling

Dissociation fitting
-bond lifetime distribution modeling

Molecular stiffness
-molecular stiffness fitting with gaussian mixture models, as well as log-gaussian mixture models, programmatically finds optimal number of mixture components based on statistical analysis of p-values, AIC and BIC
