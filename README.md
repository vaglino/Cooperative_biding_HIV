Chemical kinetics modeling of the trimolecular Env-CD4-CXCR4 reaction

Performs fitting of adhesion frequency data and bond lifetime distributions with any kinetics model scheme defined, determines kinetic rates and compares different models statistically.

Association fitting
-adhesion frequency modeling

Dissociation fitting
-bond lifetime distribution modeling
